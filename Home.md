LaTeX Workshop is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), aiming to provide all-in-one features and utilities for LaTeX typesetting with Visual Studio Code.

This project won't be successful without contributions from the community, especially the current and past key contributors:
- Jerome Lelong [`@jlelong`](https://github.com/jlelong)
- Takashi Tamura [`@tamuratak`](https://github.com/tamuratak)
- Tecosaur [`@tecosaur`](https://github.com/tecosaur)
- James Booth [`@jabooth`](https://github.com/jabooth)
